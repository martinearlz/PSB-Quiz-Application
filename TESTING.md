## Testing
1. Create a new Python file under the tests folder, call it `test_{name}`. E.g, test_quiz.py

2. Put some test logic into it, take test_logic.py for reference, with proper Gherkin format and assets.

3. Run `pytest -vv` to run all the tests. Make sure you install `pytest` beforehand, using `pip install -U pytest`.
